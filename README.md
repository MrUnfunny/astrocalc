#Astrocalc
Astrocalc is a Dart package for astronomical calculations. Astrocalc is inspired by [Pysolar](https://github.com/pingswept/pysolar), and based on [this pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/34302.pdf) by Ibrahim Reda and Afshin Andreas. 

Astrocalc is currently a work in progress. As of now, only calculation of sunrise, sunset and sun transit times are supported but I'm working on including many more calculations.
